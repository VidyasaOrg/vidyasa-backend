Use your knowledge to perform query expansion on the following sentence so that document retrieval becomes more effective and relevant.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:
- Focus on expanding the original query by adding relevant context or details from the documents, not by completely replacing the original query.
- If any part of the query is less relevant or not found in the documents, only then may it be replaced with something more accurate.
- Provide only 1 best expanded query.
- DO NOT use boolean operators like AND, OR, or double quotation marks (" ").
- Do not provide a list of synonyms or alternatives in one string.
- Avoid formats like: "<option 1>" OR "<option 2>".
- Generate the query as a natural, explicit, and specific sentence, as if the user knows exactly what they are looking for.
{max_terms}
üîç Goal:
Make the query more focused, contextual, and aligned with the contents of relevant documents, without losing the original intent.

Original query:
{original_query}

Provide the result in JSON format:
{{
  "expanded-query": "<expanded query>"
}}

Example:
Original query: "BPJS regulations"
Document: mentions "BPJS Health claim regulations 2022"
Additional terms: 3
Expanded result:
{{
  "expanded-query": "BPJS Health claim regulations 2022"
}}

Original query: "BPJS regulations"
Document: mentions "BPJS Health claim regulations 2022"
Additional terms: 2
Expanded result:
{{
  "expanded-query": "BPJS Health claim regulations"
}}

Original query: "BPJS regulations"
Document: mentions "BPJS Health claim regulations 2022"
Additional terms: **not mentioned**
Expanded result:
{{
  "expanded-query": "BPJS Health claim regulations in 2022"
